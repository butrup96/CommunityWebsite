## This project was made in the span for a few weeks and is not finished. This project is a "stomping ground" for me to learn about HTML5 and CSS3.

I felt as if I did not have enough HTML5 or CSS3 knowledge for Web Development so I made a website for an online community of friends. 
The project was never intended to be done, rather it was intended to be used as a way to get hands-on experience with HTML5 and CSS3, changing things and 
playing around with ideas.

I will include photos of the website's current look as the photos are all saved on my PC from Discord.
